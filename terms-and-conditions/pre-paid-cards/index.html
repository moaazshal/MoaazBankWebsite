<td width="1252">
The Customer must have a valid passport or other legally acceptable form of identification as per Bank's requirements. By providing the Card Application via physical signature or electronic submission through identified channels, the Customer warrants the factual accuracy of all information provided by the Customer in the Card Application. The Bank may ask the Customer to provide documentary evidence to prove the Customer's identification and/or the Bank may check all personal information given by the Customer in respect of the Customer with credit reference, anti-money laundering or fraud prevention agencies and other organizations as deemed fit by the Bank. The Bank may also perform a search on the Customer's credit file in order to verify the Customer's identity. The agencies may keep a record of the Customer's information and the searches made. If it is subsequently discovered that any information provided by the Customer to the Bank in relation to the Card and the Card Application has been falsified oris incorrect, the Bank may cancel the Card immediately without any further notice to the Customer.
</td>

<td valign="top">
1.2
</td>

The Card and/or PIN will be delivered by courier or normal mail to the address notified by the Customer at the Customer's sole risk or can be collected personally at the Bank's branch or any nominated party. In any case, the Customer will be required to present original passport (or such other identification documentation required by the Bank) for personal identification. In the event the Customer does not wish to utilize the Card, the Customer shall immediately cut the Card in half and return both halves to the Bank.
The Bank has the right to remove any Reloaded/Loaded amount which remains unutilized for 180 days from the Card and the same can be claimed by the Customer ("Refund Amount") through written request submitted to the Bank. For the avoidance of doubt, the Customer agrees to bear the standard charges of transferring the Refund Amount to the specified account(s). The Bank has no obligation to transfer any Refund Amount less than AED 0.01.

If the Card is used by a Cardholder other than the Customer, the Bank shall not be liable or responsible for investigating, verifying or authenticating the details of such Cardholder, including the identity, nationality, age, legal capacity or connection which the Cardholder has with the Customer. It is agreed that any usage of the Card by the Cardholder shall be at the sole responsibility, liability and accountability of the Customer, without any recourse by the Cardholder to the Bank.
