<h4>1. THE CARD</h4>
<br>
<ol>
<li>The Card is our property and you must return it to us immediately upon request.</li>
<li>We will deliver the Card to you by courier at your risk. The signature of an individual at your address is proof of delivery and shall constitute receipt of the Card.</li>
<li>Upon receipt of the Card, you should sign it immediately. To select the PIN and activate the Card, you must call on 600 599 995.</li>
<li>You must take all reasonable steps to keep the Card safe at all times.</li>
<li>You must not let anyone use the Card other than yourself.</li>
<li>You must keep the PIN secret and must not let anyone else know or use the PIN.</li>
<li>You shall ensure that any Supplementary Cardholder takes the steps outlined above in relation to any Card issued to them.</li>
</ol>
<br>
<h4>2. USE OF THE CARD</h4>
<br>
<ol>
<li>You may only use the Card for transactions within the Limit and until the expiry date embossed on its face.</li>
<li>We shall set the Limit and shall notify you of it. We may change the Limit at any time and notify you of any changes. You are not allowed to exceed the Limit without our prior approval.</li>
<li>Any Card Transaction originated in a currency other than your Card Currency will be converted to your Card Currency at a rate of exchange determined by Emirates Islamic Bank /Network International. Such transactions will also be subject to a currency conversion fee as determined by Emirates Islamic Bank/Network International.</li>
<li>You must not use your Card for any unlawful purpose, including the purchase of goods or services, prohibited by Islamic Shari'a or any applicable laws wherever the Card is used.</li>
</ol>
<br>
<h4>3. CASH ADVANCES USING THE CARD</h4>
<br>
<ol>
<li>You may obtain cash advances using the Card in such amounts as may be determined by us from time to time by the following means:<br />
<br />
(a) by presenting the Card at any Emirates Islamic Bank branch or any branch of a member institution of VISA International which offers such facility, together with
internationally recognised evidence of identity, and by signing the appropriate Card Transaction record; or<br />
(b) by using the Card on any Emirates Islamic Bank ATM or that of any other bank or institution with whom we have an agreement for the use of the ATM of the
said bank or institution, in which case the amount of each advance will be further subject to the applicable daily withdrawal limit of the ATM used.
</li>
<li>You will need to use the PIN in conjunction with the Card when effecting a Card Transaction at an ATM. Our record of any Card Transaction effected in conjunction with a PIN shall be conclusively binding on you.</li>
<li>Any transfer of funds from your Card to an Emirates Islamic Bank transaction account (Current account, Investment Savings account, Investment Time Deposit account) will be treated as a cash advance and will incur normal cash advance fees and charges. </li>
<li>You shall pay a cash advance fee for each cash advance you get using the Card. The Bank may, from time to time vary the amount of the cash advance fee as notified by the Bank through its branches and/or website prior to 7 days of changing the existing fee.</li>
</ol>
<br>
<h4>4. PAYMENT</h4>
<br>
<ol>
<li>You agree to pay to us a non-refundable monthly fee in the amount we may prescribe in the Tariff of Charges which will be either displayed in the branches or made public on the website, and any other fee levied by the bank including but not limited to annual fee. You shall also, at our request, pay us a handling fee for the issue of a replacement Card.</li>
<li>Monthly membership fee is a flat fee and will be charged the first time on issuance of the card and thereafter periodically. Annual fee is also charged on issuance and subsequently on each anniversary year.</li>
<li>We shall debit the Card Account with the amounts of all Card Transactions, all charges and fees payable under these terms and conditions and any other liabilities we may incur arising from the use/misuse of the Card.</li>
<li>You and any Supplementary Cardholder will be jointly and severally liable to pay all amounts debited to the Card Account.</li>
<li>We shall make available to you online/physically a Statement of Account for the Card Account. Non receipt of the Statement of Account and/ or inability to view the Card statements online shall not be construed to be sufficient reason for non-payment of amounts due to us.</li>
<li>You agree to pay to us the total amount of all charges and fees appearing in the Statement of Account as the present balance, not later than the Payment Due Date.</li>
<li>If you do not settle the outstanding payment by the Payment Due Date, and it remains unsettled at the date of issue of the next Statement of Account, the unpaid amount will be added to the next Statement of Account's minimum payment and is due immediately.</li>
<li>You are not allowed to make Card Transactions that exceed the current Limit without prior approval from us. You shall immediately upon demand by us, pay the full amount by which the Limit has been exceeded and the minimum payment then due. If you fail to make such payment in full, we may cancel the Card immediately without prior notice to you, and the whole outstanding balance on the Card Account shall become immediately due and payable. </li>
<li>Any arrears and any Card Transaction made in breach of these terms and conditions shall become immediately payable by you. </li>
<li>The bank reserves the right to charge you fees on any late payments you make, and we will channel the late fee amounts collected from you to the Charity Fund maintained by the bank.</li>
<li>All payments you make shall be applied in the following order of payment or such other order as we may think fit:<br />
<br />
(a) All unpaid fees, cash advances, charges and other costs shown on any previous Statement of Account;<br />
(b) All unpaid fees, cash advances, charges and other costs shown on the current Statement of Account; All unpaid Card Transactions (excluding cash advances) shown on any previous Statement of Account;<br />
(d) All unpaid Card Transactions (excluding cash advances) shown on the current Statement of Account; and <br />
(e) All cash advances and other Card Transactions not yet shown on the current Statement of Account.</li>
<li>We may charge a fixed fee as specified in the Tariff of Charges which will be either displayed in the branches or made public on the website for any returned unpaid cheques drawn by you/ failed standing order in full or partial payment of the outstanding balance, and this shall not affect any of the other legal remedies available to us.</li>
<li>You shall make all payments in the Card Currency. If you make payments in any other currency, you shall pay to us all exchange, commission and other charges or losses we may incur in converting such payments to the Card Currency. Such conversion shall be effected at the prevailing bank rate on the date of exchange,
which we may conclusively determine at the date of entry into the Card Account. Any payment you make in the Card Currency will be credited to the Card Account only on the date on which we receive the required funds for value in our books. Whenever a payment is received in any other currency, such a payment shall be credited on the date when the payment is converted to the Card Currency, or when the relevant funds have been received for value by us in Dubai and credited to the Card Account.</li>
<li>You shall pay additional charges in the amounts, which we may prescribe immediately upon request, for the provision of copies of sales/cash advance drafts, Statements of Account, which you may request, and any further service we may provide from time to time.</li>
<li>We may at our discretion vary the rate, method of calculation of the monthly fees, handling charges, additional charges or any other charges, as well as the period of time within which these fees and charges are payable as notified by the Bank through its branches and/or website prior to 7 days of changing the existing fee.

c) has expired;<br />
d) has breached the Bank's and/or VISA or MasterCard Agreement;<br />

<LI>Without prejudice to the foregoing, the Bank reserves its right to be exercised at any time without prior notice to the Cardholder, to apply time limitations on the validity of the Reward Points earned by the Cardholder and credited to the Cardholder's Emirates Islamic Bank Card Account.
